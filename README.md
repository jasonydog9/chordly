## Project Motivation

As a musician and developer, I’ve always been curious about why certain songs just *work*. Over the summer, I got obsessed with analyzing chord progressions and how they influence the feel of a song. This project was my way of combining that curiosity with my passion for engineering solutions.

I chose to build this as a web app because of its accessibility — and to learn the ins and outs of backend development, from writing Express API routes to setting up the AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway triggers.

Built with passion and curiosity by **Jason Yap**.

Special thanks to:
- YouTube, for being my unofficial TA — especially during the 3 painfully long days I spent struggling with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
